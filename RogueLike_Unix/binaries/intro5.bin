           COCKPIT: 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Radio:     We are under heavy fire, I repeat, we are under fire!
           The wing... the wing has taken a beating from the 
           [STATIC]. We're... Jesus, we're going down, we're
           going down... I can't fly around the [STATIC], we're
           goi[SIGNAL LOST].
Max:       What on earth was that?
Co-Pilot:  It's number two, Sir, I think it's down...
Max:       "Down"? What the hell do you mean?
Co-Pilot:  I don't know, Sir. It looks like... it looks like
           it's crashed into the side of the mountain.
Max:       Oh Jesus, I can see the wreckage...[GUNSHOTS] Ah
           my damn leg... [YELLING] Land the plane now, land the
           plane!
Co-Pilot:  I can't, Sir, there's no safe landing place.
Max:       I don't care if there isn't a safe landing place,
           either you take this thing down, or it'll be shot
           out of the sky! [VOICES] Get back to your damn
           seats!
Co-Pilot:  I... I might be able to take us down by that cliff.
           But, but it won't be a nice landing...
Max:       Fine, fine. Land the plane. Land the [GUNSHOTS].
