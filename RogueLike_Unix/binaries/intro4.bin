Date:                     October 22, 1944
To:                       Herr. Max Zimmer
                          Ahnenerbe Institute
                          [XX] Potsdammer Platz, Berlin
From:                     [XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX]
Subject:                  Operation Delays
   Max, we are old friends, and I regret having to write this
letter. It has been over a month since I ordered you to gather
your men. I am fed up of hearing about intransigent lieutenants
and equipment delays. A few days ago, Athens fell to the British
and all intelligence indicates that Aachen is soon to follow.
The need for an alternate solution to our current predicament
is growing every day - there is no time to wait for your
childish approach to authority. Can you imagine the devestation
if those barbarians in the east break through our lines in the
winter and lay waste our fatherland!? I am ordering you to leave
to the Americas as soon as you receive this letter. I'm sure I
do not need to elaborate on the consequences of failure.
