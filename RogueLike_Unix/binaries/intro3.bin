To:                       Hauptmann Schmidt
                          [XXXXXXXXX]
From:                     Herr. Max Zimmer
Subject:                  Requisition Order [XXXXX]
   Mr. Schmidt, I really was hoping I wouldn't have to send
ANOTHER letter. I have orders from the highest place that my
team and I are to have all the resources we request. Your
superiors are fully aware that I am not military, yet this has
not inhibited the extent of their support, and neither should it
yours. I do not want to go over your head on this, but if I have
to, I will.
